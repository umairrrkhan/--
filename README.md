# Language Identification

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a language identification system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the language of a given text based on its content. This README file provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and replicating the project.

## Introduction

Language identification, also known as language detection, is a fundamental task in natural language processing. It has applications in various fields, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to create a language identification model.

## Dataset

We use the "Language Detection.csv" dataset for training and testing our language identification model. This dataset contains text samples from multiple languages, making it suitable for our task.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `Language Identification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and explanations.
- `Language Detection.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for the project.
- `data/`: A directory containing any additional data or resources.
- `models/`: A directory where trained models are saved.
- `results/`: A directory to store project results and reports.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/umairrrkhan/language-identification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```shell
  cd language-identification
  ```
## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook Language Identification.ipynb:

  ```shell
  jupyter notebook Language Identification.ipynb
  ```

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:

- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Train the language identification model
- Evaluate the model's performance
- Make language predictions on new text samples

## Data Preprocessing

In the notebook, you'll find detailed explanations of the data preprocessing steps, including:

- Text cleaning (removing special characters, whitespace, etc.)
- Tokenization
- Feature extraction (using techniques like Count Vectorization)

## Model Training

We use the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for language identification. The notebook provides code for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection.

## Evaluation

The performance of the language identification model is assessed using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. These metrics are explained in detail in the notebook.

## Results

The project's results, including model performance and any interesting insights, are summarized in the notebook.
